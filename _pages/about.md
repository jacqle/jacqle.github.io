I am a PhD candidate at Orange and Aix-Marseille University working on conversational AI. I am happy to be working with <a href='https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=n42dh0cAAAAJ&hl=en'>Lina M. Rojas Barahona</a> (Orange) and <a href='https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/benoit.favre/'>Benoit Favre</a> (AMU). My thesis focuses on dialogue state tracking, a task concerned with capturing the user's needs throughout the course of a dialogue. I am especially interested in exploring novel state representations that can suit the practical requirements of task-oriented dialogue systems.

Previously, I received my master's degree in Natural Language Processing from the University of Lorraine. I interned at Orange where I worked on multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis as part of my master's research project.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, reading, meditating, and much more.
